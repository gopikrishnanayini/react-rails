# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:
add gem in the gemfile
gem 'react-rails'
then run bundle install
then run
rails g react:install

add index.html.erb file
<%= react_component 'Main' %>

then add main component in assets/javascripts/components/_main.js.jsx
